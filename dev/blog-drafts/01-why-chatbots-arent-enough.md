# **Why Your AI Chatbot Isn't Enough: The Case for Structured PM Workflows**

Most PMs are using AI like a single-threaded Q&A: ask â†’ answer â†’ forget.  After a session coding an application with an AI-Coding assistant, I had the breakthrough thought - if this AI-Coding assistant can make decisions and create code by analysing hundreds of files containing source code, scripts etc, it could do the same with data held in Markdown files

This combination of AI Coding assistant and local Markdown files allows me to utilise the power of AI not in a single-threaded 'please help me improve this doc', but instead have a knowledge base where I can ask the AI to help with a task, whilst having access to ALL the data I need it to.

As a PM, being able to analyse a PRD in a tool like Cursor, against a variety of data sources, from interviews to competitive intel, whilst cross-referencing against our Personas and GTM strategy is HUGE.  And yes... I know... MCP allows me to connect to a variety of sources etc etc. But trust me, you can get a team up and running on an AI-Coding Assistant of your choice, using Markdown files as data sources, all backed into GitHub in hours.

### **ðŸ§  The Institutional Memory Problem**

Here's what traditional AI chats get wrong: they don't build organisational knowledge. Every conversation starts from zero. Your team's collective insights, past decisions, and hard-won learnings disappear into the void.

When I ask an AI assistant to analyse a PRD, it can only work with what I gave it in that single conversation. It had no memory of our previous discussions about developer pain points, no context about why we'd made certain architectural decisions, and no understanding of our team's evolving strategy.

This creates a dangerous pattern: **reactive decision-making**. You're always responding to problems after they emerge, never anticipating them.

### **ðŸ¤– Coding Assistants: Why Let Developers Have All the Fun?**

The magic starts when you give your AI a permanent home to work from. Using an AI-coding agent (like Cursor/Claude Code/Google Code) with local markdown files is the easiest, quickest way to create an AI-assisted knowledge platform.

Instead of spending days on manual research, you can delegate the initial build-out of the corpus to the AI.

â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ competitive-intel/  
â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ prd/

**Prompt:** *"Examine the websites and docs for competitorA.com and https://www.google.com/search?q=competitorB.com. Create a detailed overview for each in a new markdown file inside /competitive-intel/."*

This transforms hours of tedious work into a permanent, queryable asset. What was once scattered knowledge now becomes a shared source of truth, creating instant team alignment.

No copying things in and out of the ChatGPT chat. No creating endless Google Docs by exporting out of Gemini.  Now you have a structured way of getting AI to store, process, enhance, build and analyse the data you need to make your decisions from.

### **âš¡ The Speed of AI-Assisted Knowledge Platform Building**

This is where the real power is: **I built the first version of my customer interview framework in under an hour.**

Traditional approach would have taken weeks:
- Research interview best practices
- Write questions from scratch  
- Create templates manually
- Test and iterate
- Document everything

With AI-coding agents and AI-assisted knowledge platform building, I had:
- **200+ interview questions** organized by persona type and product stage
- **Structured 45-minute template** with timing and scripts to help people get the most out of the interview
- **Processing workflow** for turning raw notes and video-call transcripts into standardised insights
- **Complete documentation** and guides to help people
- **and all published into GitHub** as a 'sample' so you can see how it works

All built in one focused session. The AI didn't replace my judgmentâ€”it amplified my capability to build professional AI-assisted knowledge platforms at startup speed.

### **ðŸ§  The Real Payoff: Advanced Analysis**

Once this foundation exists, the AI's role shifts from data retrieval to genuine synthesis. You can now perform complex, cross-document analysis that just isn't possible in a web UI.

**Prompt:** *"Compare the capabilities in competitor\_a/analysis.md and competitor\_b/analysis.md against our vision in prd/new\_feature\_q4.md. Analyze this through the lens of our personas and highlight our competitive advantages."*

The AI now has a rich, interconnected dataset at its fingertips. It stops being a simple chatbot and **starts becoming a true analytical partner.**

### **ðŸš€ From Reactive to Proactive Decision Making**

The real velocity comes when this corpus evolves from a static library into a dynamic repository for all project knowledge.

Every piece of new informationâ€”raw customer interview notes, sales team feedback, key decisions from Slackâ€”enriches the corpus. Instead of data sitting passively in folders, it becomes active intelligence. Customer pain points automatically refine your personas. Field feedback can be instantly cross-referenced against the roadmap. The 'why' behind a decision made months ago is never lost.

**Prompt:** *"Based on the last five interview transcripts, what new pain points should be added to personas/ceo\_carl.md? Update the file directly."*

This creates a virtuous cycle: the more you feed the corpus, the more insightful it becomes, allowing you to proactively spot gaps and opportunities.

**Prompt:** *"Cross-reference field\_feedback.md against our current PRDs. What are the top 3 requested features that are not being addressed?"*

This workflow elevates AI from a simple query tool to a strategic partner. It grants your team a perfect, collective memory, driving faster decisions and tighter alignment.

### **ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Transform Your PM Workflow?**

If you're tired of the "single-threaded" conversations you are having with your favourite AI chatbot, and ready to build an AI-assisted knowledge platform that actually grows smarter over time, you're not alone. The future of product management isn't about better chatbotsâ€”it's about AI-assisted knowledge platforms that preserve context and enable proactive decision-making.
