# Customer Interview Best Practices

## üéØ The Golden Rules

### 1. Listen More Than You Talk
- **70% listening, 30% talking**
- **Ask questions, then shut up**
- **Let silence work for you** - people will fill it with valuable information
- **Don't interrupt** - let them finish their thoughts

### 2. Get Specific Examples
- **"Tell me about the last time this happened"**
- **"Can you walk me through exactly what you did?"**
- **"What did that look like in practice?"**
- **Avoid**: "How often does this happen?" (they'll guess)
- **Instead**: "When was the last time this happened?" (they'll remember)

### 3. Focus on Problems, Not Solutions
- **Don't pitch your product** during discovery
- **Understand their world first**
- **Let them tell you what they need**
- **Save solutions for follow-up conversations**

## üéØ Question Techniques That Work

### The "5 Whys" Method
When someone mentions a problem, ask "why" 5 times to get to the root cause:

**Example**:
- "We have trouble tracking competitors"
- "Why is that a problem?" ‚Üí "We're always behind on updates"
- "Why is being behind a problem?" ‚Üí "Our customers tell us about competitor changes"
- "Why is that a problem?" ‚Üí "It's embarrassing and we look unprepared"
- "Why is that a problem?" ‚Üí "We lose credibility and potentially deals"
- "Why is that a problem?" ‚Üí "It affects our revenue and growth"

### The "Last Time" Technique
Instead of asking about general experiences, ask about the most recent occurrence:

- **Bad**: "How often do you have this problem?"
- **Good**: "When was the last time this happened?"
- **Better**: "Can you walk me through exactly what happened the last time this was a problem?"

### The "Impact" Technique
Always dig into the business impact:

- **"What happens when this goes wrong?"**
- **"Who else is affected by this?"**
- **"How much time/money does this cost you?"**
- **"What's the worst case scenario?"**

### The "Alternative" Technique
Understand what they're doing instead:

- **"How do you currently handle this?"**
- **"What's your workaround?"**
- **"What would you do if this problem got worse?"**
- **"Have you tried other solutions?"**

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Leading Questions
**Bad**: "Don't you think this process is inefficient?"
**Good**: "How do you feel about this process?"

**Bad**: "Wouldn't it be better if you could automate this?"
**Good**: "What would make this process better for you?"

### 2. Yes/No Questions
**Bad**: "Do you have problems with your current system?"
**Good**: "Tell me about your current system and how it's working for you."

**Bad**: "Are you interested in a solution?"
**Good**: "What would you need to see to be interested in a solution?"

### 3. Assuming Context
**Bad**: "How do you handle the integration issues?"
**Good**: "Walk me through your integration process."

**Bad**: "What about the security concerns?"
**Good**: "What security considerations do you have?"

### 4. Multiple Questions at Once
**Bad**: "What's your biggest challenge with the current system, and how much time does it take, and who else is affected?"
**Good**: "What's your biggest challenge with the current system?" [Wait for answer] "How much time does this take you?"

### 5. Technical Jargon
**Bad**: "How do you handle the API rate limiting and error handling?"
**Good**: "When the system gets overwhelmed or breaks, what happens?"

## üé≠ Handling Different Personality Types

### The Talker
**Signs**: Dominates conversation, goes off on tangents
**Strategy**: 
- **Interrupt politely**: "That's really interesting, let me ask you about..."
- **Redirect**: "Going back to what you mentioned about..."
- **Use their energy**: "You clearly have strong opinions about this"

### The Quiet One
**Signs**: Short answers, doesn't elaborate
**Strategy**:
- **Ask open-ended questions**: "Tell me more about that"
- **Use silence**: Count to 5 after they answer
- **Be patient**: Some people need time to think
- **Ask for examples**: "Can you give me a specific example?"

### The Skeptic
**Signs**: Questions everything, seems defensive
**Strategy**:
- **Acknowledge their concerns**: "I understand why you'd be skeptical"
- **Focus on problems, not solutions**: Don't pitch yet
- **Ask about their experience**: "What's made you skeptical about solutions like this?"

### The Expert
**Signs**: Knows everything, wants to show off knowledge
**Strategy**:
- **Let them teach you**: "I'd love to learn from your experience"
- **Ask for their opinion**: "What do you think is the best approach?"
- **Use their expertise**: "Given your background, what would you recommend?"

## üìù Note-Taking Best Practices

### What to Capture
- **Direct quotes**: Use quotation marks
- **Specific examples**: With dates, numbers, names
- **Emotional language**: "frustrating", "terrible", "love"
- **Business impact**: Time, money, people affected
- **Decision process**: Who, when, how much

### How to Take Notes
- **Use bullet points**: Don't try to write full sentences
- **Use abbreviations**: "PM" not "Product Manager"
- **Mark important points**: Use stars, exclamation points
- **Note follow-ups**: Mark questions to ask later
- **Record emotions**: Note tone, enthusiasm level

## üí° Advanced Techniques

### The "Job to be Done" Framework
Instead of asking about features, ask about the job they're trying to get done:

- **"What job are you trying to get done when you [specific task]?"**
- **"What does success look like for that job?"**
- **"What's preventing you from doing that job well?"**

### The "Emotional Journey" Technique
Map their emotional state through their process:

- **"How do you feel when you start this process?"**
- **"What's the most stressful part?"**
- **"How do you feel when it's done?"**
- **"What would make you feel confident about this process?"**

### The "Future State" Technique
Help them imagine their ideal world:

- **"If you could wake up tomorrow and this problem was solved, what would that look like?"**
- **"What would your day look like if this process was perfect?"**
- **"How would you measure success in that world?"**

**Remember**: Great interviews are conversations, not interrogations. Build rapport, show genuine interest, and focus on understanding their world.
