ALEX: Hi Jennifer, thanks for joining us today. I understand you're looking for better competitive intelligence tools?

JENNIFER: Yes, absolutely. We're a data analytics company, so we should be good at tracking competitors, but honestly, we're not. It's ironic.

ALEX: What's your current process like?

JENNIFER: We have one person - me - trying to track everything manually. I check competitor websites weekly, read industry newsletters, follow them on LinkedIn. But I'm missing things constantly. Last week I found out CompetitorY launched a new pricing model three weeks ago. Three weeks!

ALEX: That's a significant delay. What impact does that have?

JENNIFER: It's costing us deals. Prospects are asking about features we don't have, pricing we can't match, because we didn't know our competitors were offering them. Our sales team is frustrated because they're always playing catch-up.

ALEX: What specific information do you need to track?

JENNIFER: Pricing changes are critical. Feature announcements. New customer wins. Funding rounds. Partnership announcements. Basically anything that could affect our competitive position.

ALEX: How do you currently organize this information?

JENNIFER: I have a massive spreadsheet that's impossible to navigate. Different tabs for different competitors, but it's not searchable, not shareable, and definitely not real-time.

ALEX: Who else needs access to this information?

JENNIFER: Our CEO wants weekly updates. Sales team needs immediate alerts. Product team needs to know about new features. Marketing wants to track messaging changes. Right now I'm the bottleneck.

ALEX: What would make your life easier?

JENNIFER: Automation. I need something that monitors competitors automatically and sends me alerts when something changes. Not just website changes, but also social media, press releases, job postings - anything that indicates they're working on something new.

ALEX: How would you want to receive these updates?

JENNIFER: Email alerts for urgent changes, maybe a dashboard for the team to check regularly. Integration with Slack would be great - we could have a #competitive-intel channel.

ALEX: What's your biggest competitive threat right now?

JENNIFER: CompetitorY is moving fast and they have better funding. They're also more aggressive with pricing. We need to know immediately when they change their strategy.

ALEX: Any budget constraints?

JENNIFER: We're a startup, so cost matters. Maybe $200-500 per month? But if it saves me 10 hours per week, it's worth it.

ALEX: What would success look like?

JENNIFER: Being proactive instead of reactive. Knowing about competitor changes before our customers do. Having the whole team aligned on our competitive landscape.
