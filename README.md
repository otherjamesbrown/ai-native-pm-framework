# 🚀 AI-Native PM Framework

> **Stop chatting, start building a knowledge corpus**

A staging platform that helps Product Managers transition from fragmented AI chat interactions to structured, knowledge-driven workflows using AI coding assistants like Cursor.

## 🎯 The Problem

Most PMs use ChatGPT like a calculator: ask a question, get an answer, move on. This breaks down fast when you need to juggle personas, PRDs, and competitive intel—and AI isn't keeping up.

## ✨ The Solution

Transform your AI from a simple chatbot into a **strategic analytical partner** by building a permanent, queryable knowledge base.

### Key Benefits:
- **80% of enterprise framework benefits** with 20% of the complexity
- **Context-aware workflows** backed by GitHub for collaboration
- **Progressive complexity** that grows with your needs
- **Clear migration path** to advanced frameworks

## 🏗️ Core Elements

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
1. **Customer Insights** - Raw data (interviews, tickets, analytics)
2. **Decision Logs** - Audit trail of choices and rationale
3. **PRDs** - Living documents that evolve
4. **Success Metrics** - Measurable outcomes

*This creates a complete feedback loop: Input → Process → Output → Validation*
