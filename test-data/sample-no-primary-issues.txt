JANE: Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today, John. Can you tell me about your current process?

JOHN: Sure, Jane. We have a few different tools we use for tracking things. Some work well, others could be better.

JANE: What challenges do you face?

JOHN: Well, we have some minor issues with our current setup. The interface could be more user-friendly, and sometimes the data takes a while to load. Nothing major though.

JANE: What features would you like to see?

JOHN: It would be nice to have better reporting capabilities. Maybe some integration options. Nothing urgent though - we're managing fine with what we have.

JANE: Any competitors you're concerned about?

JOHN: There are a few companies in our space, but we're not too worried about them. We have our own approach.

JANE: What would success look like for you?

JOHN: Just continuing to improve our current processes. We're not looking for any major changes right now.
