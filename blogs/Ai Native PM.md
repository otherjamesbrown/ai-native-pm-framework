# **My Product Management AI Workflow: Stop Chatting, Start Building a Knowledge Corpus**

Most people use ChatGPT like a calculator: ask a question, get an answer, move on. As a Product Manager, that broke down fast. I needed to juggle personas, PRDs, and competitive intel—and AI wasn’t keeping up. The breakthrough came when I stopped chatting and started building a knowledge corpus.

The "Aha\!" moment that cemented this came a few months ago.

We were expanding our product to a new, more technical audience. We'd spent weeks building our "Developer Diana" persona and had just drafted a major PRD for a feature we were sure they'd love.

Before shipping it to engineering, I ran one last check. I asked my AI assistant:

**"Analyze this PRD against our raw support tickets and interview notes from our developer beta users."**

I expected it to tell me we'd nailed it. Instead, it flagged a massive blind spot.

The AI reported that while our feature was *functionally* what they asked for, the **\#1 complaint** from developers was our clunky API and lack of clear documentation—something our PRD didn't mention at all.

We were about to build a brand new room onto a house with a cracked foundation. That's when I knew a simple chat interface wasn't enough.

### **🧠 The Institutional Memory Problem**

Here's what traditional AI chats get wrong: they don't build organizational knowledge. Every conversation starts from zero. Your team's collective insights, past decisions, and hard-won learnings disappear into the void.

When I asked that AI assistant to analyze our PRD, it could only work with what I gave it in that single conversation. It had no memory of our previous discussions about developer pain points, no context about why we'd made certain architectural decisions, and no understanding of our team's evolving strategy.

This creates a dangerous pattern: **reactive decision-making**. You're always responding to problems after they emerge, never anticipating them.

### **🤖 Coding Assistants: Why Let Developers Have All the Fun?**

The magic starts when you give your AI a permanent home to work from. By using a coding assistant like **Cursor** with a library of Markdown files, you create a powerful, context-aware workflow backed by GitHub for collaboration.

Instead of spending days on manual research, you can delegate the initial build-out of the corpus to the AI.

├── 📂 personas/  
├── 📂 competitive-intel/  
└── 📂 prd/

**Prompt:** *"Examine the websites and docs for competitorA.com and https://www.google.com/search?q=competitorB.com. Create a detailed overview for each in a new markdown file inside /competitive-intel/."*

This transforms hours of tedious work into a permanent, queryable asset. What was once scattered knowledge now becomes a shared source of truth, creating instant team alignment.

### **🧠 The Real Payoff: Advanced Analysis**

Once this foundation exists, the AI's role shifts from data retrieval to genuine synthesis. You can now perform complex, cross-document analysis that just isn’t possible in a web UI.

**Prompt:** *"Compare the capabilities in competitor\_a/analysis.md and competitor\_b/analysis.md against our vision in prd/new\_feature\_q4.md. Analyze this through the lens of our personas and highlight our competitive advantages."*

The AI now has a rich, interconnected dataset at its fingertips. It stops being a simple chatbot and **starts becoming a true analytical partner.**

### **🚀 From Reactive to Proactive Decision Making**

The real velocity comes when this corpus evolves from a static library into a dynamic repository for all project knowledge.

Every piece of new information—raw customer interview notes, sales team feedback, key decisions from Slack—enriches the corpus. Instead of data sitting passively in folders, it becomes active intelligence. Customer pain points automatically refine your personas. Field feedback can be instantly cross-referenced against the roadmap. The 'why' behind a decision made months ago is never lost.

**Prompt:** *"Based on the last five interview transcripts, what new pain points should be added to personas/ceo\_carl.md? Update the file directly."*

This creates a virtuous cycle: the more you feed the corpus, the more insightful it becomes, allowing you to proactively spot gaps and opportunities.

**Prompt:** *"Cross-reference field\_feedback.md against our current PRDs. What are the top 3 requested features that are not being addressed?"*

This workflow elevates AI from a simple query tool to a strategic partner. It grants your team a perfect, collective memory, driving faster decisions and tighter alignment.

### **🎯 Ready to Transform Your PM Workflow?**

If you're tired of the "calculator problem" and ready to build a knowledge base that actually grows smarter over time, you're not alone. The future of product management isn't about better chatbots—it's about structured workflows that preserve context and enable proactive decision-making.

**Next Steps:**
- Download our [AI-Native PM Framework](https://github.com/yourusername/ai-native-pm-framework) 
- Start with our [Getting Started Guide](workflows/getting-started.md)
- Join the community of PMs building the future of product management

The question isn't whether AI will transform product management—it's whether you'll be leading that transformation or playing catch-up.
